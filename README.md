#Daily-Planner

The followoing code is for a daily planner.
The boxes with a grey background are for past times.
The box with a red background is the current time.
The boxes with a green background are for future times.
Once information has been typed into the box it should save once the blue save button on the side is clicked.
If the page is refreshed the data should still remain on the page.
